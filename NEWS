Overview of Changes in 0.90.0 (since 0.53.1)
============================================
Too many changes to be listed, let's take a summary.
This new version is extremely customizable with a huge number of new 
options. Those new options allow the user to achieve an incredible 
variety of styles.
In order to add those features the engine was rewritten in many parts, 
sometimes even 2 or 3 times! :-) This results in a simpler code, more 
readable and more maintainable, with a lot of custom code moved from 
each widget drawing function (before) to a general murrine drawing 
support file (now). For example adding a new glaze style will now cost 
about 20 lines and it will be applied immediately to every single 
widget.
Murrine can finally use the alpha channel to draw a real transparent 
theme, all it needs is an application using the RGBA colormap and a 
theme with the rgba option enabled.
During the whole development, murrine was kept in sync with 
every bugfix that hit gtk-engines, so this new version can also be  
considered much more stable than the previous one.
