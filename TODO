Arrows:
- add arrowstyle, get one style from nodoka's 0.8 branch

Notebooks:
- adjust highlight, doesn't look perfectly with dark themes

Menu:
- fix menustyle = 1 with rtl

Scrollbars:
- try to use spot[2] for handles and border when colorize_scrollbar is enabled
- fix rounded corners when using a dark color on a bright background, 
  seems an issue in the clip, maybe I should increase the roundness of 
  the clipped area.
